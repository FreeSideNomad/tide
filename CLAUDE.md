## Critical Development Process

**üö® MANDATORY: NO CODE WITHOUT EXPLICIT STAKEHOLDER APPROVAL**

### 4-Phase Development Workflow

**Phase 1: Planning & Collaboration**
1. Collaborate on .md files (documentation and requirements)
2. Stakeholder review and feedback on .md files
3. **Wait for explicit approval** before proceeding

**Phase 2: Issue Creation**
4. Create GitHub Issues (Epic, Feature, User Story) based on approved .md files
5. Issue-driven development approach

**Phase 3: Implementation Cycle (Per User Story)**
6. **Get explicit approval** for each user story before starting
7. Create feature branch for specific user story
8. Implement & test until all tests pass
9. Commit & merge to remote main, fix build issues

**Phase 4: Validation & Iteration**
10. Stakeholder manual testing
11. Create GitHub issues for problems found
12. Fix & merge code
13. Repeat until user story complete
14. Move to next user story only after completion

### Essential Rules
- ‚úÖ Collaborate on .md files freely
- ‚ùå Never implement code without explicit stakeholder approval
- ‚ùå Never create GitHub issues without approved requirements
- ‚ùå Never merge code without passing tests and build validation

## Technology Stack

### Approved Technologies
- **Frontend**: Python Flet for cross-platform mobile and web deployment
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector for RAG storage
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy for maintainability and type safety
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API with cost management
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth or Microsoft OAuth
- **Testing**: Pytest for unit tests and integration tests, standard Python testing practices for Flet applications
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions + cloud provider

### Technology Guidelines
1. **Simplicity over sophistication** - choose boring, proven technologies
2. **GitHub integration** - prioritize tools that work well with GitHub
3. **User experience** - optimize for end-user productivity
4. **Testing support** - ensure technologies support automated testing
5. **AI integration** - consider how well tools work with LLM APIs

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Domain-First Architecture
- Core business domain comes first
- Supporting domains (auth, user management) come later
- Start with business entity modeling
- Define core use cases before technical infrastructure
- Defer authentication until business logic is validated

### 2. GitHub-Native Development
- Use GitHub as single source of truth for all project artifacts
- Vision and context in GitHub Wiki
- Work tracking through GitHub Issues
- Project management via GitHub Projects
- Code in GitHub repositories
- Automation through GitHub Actions

### 3. User-Centric Validation
- Validate every significant decision with users before implementation
- Present plans as GitHub Issues for review
- Create UI mocks in structured format (Markdown/YAML) before coding
- Implement feedback loops at every stage
- Prioritize user experience over technical elegance

### 4. Essential Use Cases Methodology
- Follow Alistair Cockburn's Essential Use Cases approach
- Start with essential user goals and intentions
- Avoid technical implementation details initially
- Focus on "what" before "how"
- Progressive refinement through structured formats

## Database Architecture

### PostgreSQL Setup
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL for all structured data
- **Vector Storage**: pgvector extension for RAG capabilities
- **Conversation Storage**: Full conversation logging and context
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy for database operations
- **Migrations**: Alembic for database schema management

### Data Storage Strategy
- Conversational data in PostgreSQL tables
- Vector embeddings in pgvector for similarity search
- Document storage in GitHub (prefer github wiki) with version control. Current versions of documents also stored in RAG vectors in PostgreSQL

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 90% for business logic with pytest unit and integration tests, 90% of code lines, branches
- **Code Review**: All changes require review via GitHub PR
- **Documentation**: Every public API documented
- **Performance**: Response times under 2 seconds for user interactions

### Development Quality
- **Linting**: Follow Python black formatting
- **Type Hints**: Use type annotations for better maintainability
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Security**: Never expose secrets or API keys

## AI Integration Guidelines

### OpenAI API Usage
- **Cost Management**: Monitor token usage and implement rate limiting
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when API unavailable
- **Context Management**: Efficient prompt engineering for cost control
- **Security**: Secure API key storage and usage patterns

### Conversation Management
- **Logging**: Full conversation audit trail in PostgreSQL
- **Context**: Dynamic context retrieval for relevant responses
- **Privacy**: Secure handling of conversation data
- **Performance**: Optimize for response time and user experience

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Process Violations
1. **Skipping Vision/Requirements Phase**: Never implement without consulting essential use cases
2. **No UI Design Consultation**: Create mockups before any UI implementation
3. **Feature Creep**: Validate business need before adding features
4. **Violating Domain-First Principle**: Start with core business domain, not UI/infrastructure

### Technical Mistakes
1. **Premature Optimization**: Focus on working functionality first
2. **Over-Engineering**: Keep solutions simple and maintainable
3. **Ignoring Test Coverage**: Maintain quality standards from the start
4. **Security Oversights**: Follow security best practices consistently

## Remember

**"Start simple, validate early, iterate based on feedback, and let the business domain drive technical decisions."**

Always prioritize:
1. User needs over technical elegance
2. Working software over perfect documentation
3. Stakeholder feedback over assumptions
4. Domain modeling over technical implementation
5. Security and quality over speed of delivery

## Flet Testing Guidelines

### Testing Strategy for Flet Applications
- **Business Logic Separation**: Extract application logic into separate functions/classes that can be unit tested independently of Flet UI components
- **Unit Testing**: Test individual functions, event handlers, state management, data processing, and validation logic using pytest
- **Integration Testing**: Test component interactions, page navigation, state updates, and data flow between components
- **Test Structure**: Organize tests following pytest conventions with `test_*.py` naming and proper fixture usage

### Pytest Configuration
- Follow pytest conventions for Python test discovery
- Use fixtures for managing test dependencies and state
- Implement parametrization to avoid redundant test code
- Generate test coverage reports for quality assurance
- Integrate with GitHub Actions for continuous integration

### Testing Best Practices
- Separate UI code from business logic for effective testing
- Test event handlers and state management functions independently
- Use mocking for external dependencies
- Maintain high test coverage for core application functionality
- Follow standard Python testing practices adapted for Flet applications
