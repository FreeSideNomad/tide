# Stakeholder Approval Process

## Overview

This document defines the mandatory stakeholder approval process for security and architecture decisions in the Tide project. This process ensures that critical decisions are properly reviewed and authorized before implementation.

## üö® Critical Requirements

### Security Decision Authority
- **NO** security decisions without stakeholder consultation
- **NO** architecture changes without ADR approval
- **NO** implementation of security features without authorization
- **ALL** security-impacting decisions require formal ADR process

### Implementation Blocking
- Features requiring security decisions are **BLOCKED** until ADR approval
- Code containing unauthorized security decisions **MUST** be refactored
- Deployment is **PROHIBITED** without proper security approval

## ADR (Architecture Decision Record) Process

### When ADR is Required

ADRs are **MANDATORY** for:

#### Security Decisions
- [ ] Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- [ ] Token storage and session management
- [ ] Data encryption and protection methods
- [ ] API security implementations
- [ ] User data handling procedures
- [ ] Compliance and regulatory requirements

#### Architecture Decisions
- [ ] Database schema changes
- [ ] Integration patterns and external services
- [ ] Performance and scalability solutions
- [ ] Infrastructure and deployment approaches
- [ ] Third-party library selections (security-sensitive)

#### Safety-First Decisions
- [ ] Crisis detection mechanisms
- [ ] Human oversight integration
- [ ] Safety plan implementations
- [ ] User wellbeing features
- [ ] Emergency response procedures

### ADR Creation Process

1. **GitHub Issue Creation**
   - Go to [New Issue](https://github.com/FreeSideNomad/tide/issues/new/choose)
   - Select **"ADR - Architecture Decision Record"** template
   - GitHub will auto-populate with ADR template structure
   - Update title: Replace `ADR-XXXX: [Decision Title]` with actual number and title
   - Fill out all template sections completely
   - Assign to required stakeholders after creation

2. **Required Content**
   - [ ] **Context**: What problem requires a decision?
   - [ ] **Proposed Decision**: What is being proposed?
   - [ ] **Rationale**: Why this approach?
   - [ ] **Consequences**: Benefits, risks, trade-offs
   - [ ] **Alternatives**: What else was considered?
   - [ ] **Implementation Requirements**: How to implement
   - [ ] **Validation Criteria**: How to verify success

### Required Stakeholders

Each ADR must specify required approvers:

#### Core Approvers (Always Required)
- [ ] **Product Owner/Stakeholder**: Business requirements and user impact
- [ ] **Technical Lead**: Technical architecture and feasibility
- [ ] **Security Reviewer**: Security implications and compliance

#### Additional Approvers (Context-Dependent)
- [ ] **Compliance Reviewer**: For healthcare/privacy decisions
- [ ] **DevOps/Infrastructure**: For deployment/infrastructure decisions
- [ ] **UX/Design**: For user-facing security features
- [ ] **Legal/Privacy**: For regulatory compliance decisions

### Approval Workflow

1. **Issue Assignment**
   - Assign GitHub issue to all required approvers
   - Set appropriate milestone and priority
   - Add to relevant project board

2. **Review Period**
   - Minimum 24-48 hours for stakeholder review
   - Extended period for complex decisions (up to 1 week)
   - Discussion via GitHub issue comments

3. **Approval Methods**

   #### Option 1: Comment-Based Approval
   ```
   **Approved**: [Stakeholder Name] - [Date]
   Comments: [Any conditions or notes]
   ```

   #### Option 2: Reaction-Based Approval
   - üëç = Approved
   - üëé = Rejected
   - ‚ùì = Needs clarification
   - üö´ = Blocking concerns

   #### Option 3: Checklist Updates
   - Update approval checkboxes in issue description
   - Add approval comments with reasoning

4. **Decision Finalization**
   - **All required approvers must provide approval**
   - Issue status changed to "Accepted" (closed with acceptance)
   - Implementation can proceed only after acceptance
   - Create implementation tracking issues if needed

## Implementation Authorization

### Before Implementation
- [ ] ADR GitHub issue status = "Accepted" (closed)
- [ ] All required approvers have provided explicit approval
- [ ] Implementation plan reviewed and approved
- [ ] Security implications fully understood
- [ ] Validation criteria defined and agreed upon

### During Implementation
- [ ] Follow ADR requirements exactly
- [ ] Document any deviations or discoveries
- [ ] Update implementation status on related issues
- [ ] Conduct security review at key milestones

### After Implementation
- [ ] Validate against ADR criteria
- [ ] Security testing completed
- [ ] Stakeholder acceptance testing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Close implementation tracking issues

## Decision Types and Examples

### High-Priority Security Decisions

#### Authentication & Authorization
- OAuth provider selection and configuration
- Token storage mechanisms (client vs server)
- Session management approaches
- Multi-factor authentication requirements
- Role-based access control implementations

#### Data Protection
- Encryption methods and key management
- Personal health information handling
- Database security configurations
- API data validation and sanitization
- Audit logging requirements

### Architecture Decisions

#### System Integration
- Third-party service integrations
- API design patterns
- Database architecture changes
- Caching strategies
- Performance optimization approaches

#### Infrastructure
- Deployment pipeline security
- Container security configurations
- Network security policies
- Monitoring and alerting systems
- Backup and disaster recovery

## Emergency Procedures

### Security Incidents
1. **Immediate Action**: Stop deployment/rollback if necessary
2. **Stakeholder Notification**: Alert security team and stakeholders
3. **Emergency ADR**: Create emergency ADR for incident response
4. **Expedited Review**: 2-4 hour approval window for critical fixes
5. **Post-Incident**: Full ADR process for permanent solution

### Urgent Business Requirements
1. **Risk Assessment**: Document security and safety implications
2. **Temporary Approval**: Stakeholder can provide emergency approval
3. **Time-Boxed Implementation**: Maximum 48-72 hours
4. **Follow-Up ADR**: Full ADR process required within 1 week
5. **Review and Refactor**: Permanent solution per ADR requirements

## Compliance and Auditing

### ADR Documentation
- All ADRs maintained in Git repository
- Decision history preserved in GitHub issues
- Approval trail documented and auditable
- Regular review of ADR effectiveness

### Security Review
- Quarterly review of all security ADRs
- Annual compliance assessment
- External security audit preparation
- Stakeholder approval process effectiveness review

## Tools and Templates

### GitHub Issue Templates
- **ADR Template**: "ADR - Architecture Decision Record" issue template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/adr-architecture-decision-record.md`)
- **Auto-populated**: Template content automatically loaded when creating ADR issues
- **Integrated Workflow**: Labels, assignees, and approval checklists built-in

### Approval Tracking
- GitHub issue assignments for stakeholder tracking
- Project board for ADR workflow visibility
- Automated reminders for pending approvals

### Documentation
- ADR registry maintained in `/docs/adr/`
- Decision index with current status
- Implementation tracking and validation

## Summary

**üö® CRITICAL REMINDER**: No security or architecture decisions can be implemented without following this ADR process. All stakeholders must explicitly approve decisions before any implementation work begins.

**Current Blocking Issues**:
- Issue #13 (ADR-0001): OAuth Token Storage Architecture - PENDING APPROVAL

This process ensures safety-first architecture, regulatory compliance, and stakeholder alignment for all critical decisions in the Tide project.
